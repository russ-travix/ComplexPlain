ComplexPlane
============

A framework for experimenting with visualising the Complex plane and various other Graphical experiments. The Fractal code supports MAP palette files from the great program FRACTINT.

The top functions are for generating fractal style images using the selected algorithm in the drop down list.
When a fractal is rendered, you can drag a rectangle and press Z to zoom on that area of the complex plain.
 * Press ESC to reset to the default parameters.

Pressing L will let you load a new colour map, see the Maps folder in the root of the repository for some examples
If the selected Algorithm is a Mandlebrot function, you may be able to see it's corresponding Julia set for each point in the plain.
To do this, single-click and the cursor will change into a preview of that area, double-clicking will generate the whole julia set to the window. Press escape to cancel the full screen view, and again to reset the cursor.

The middle drop down list and buttons are visualising various prime number sets and some experimental mathematical functions.
The idea is to look for patterns in the render. For example, the Ullam views show the Prime spiral (both circular and rectangular) which shown an apaprent tendancy for numbers that are prime to appear in diagonal lines.

The last group of buttons are little graphical experiements that I've been playing with and wanted to re-use my framework code for simplicity.
YMMV!

Have fun and enjoy.
